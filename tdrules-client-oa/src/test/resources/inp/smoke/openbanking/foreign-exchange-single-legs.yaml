  title: Bankable Assets API - FX Spots, Forwards and Non Deliverable Forwards
  version: 0.1.0
  description: >-
    # Summary
    
      Foreign exchange trade initiation and execution for FX spot, FX forward and non-deliverable forwards. 

      The API is to initiate and execute foreign exchange transactions. A foreign exchange transaction is an agreement between 
      two parties to buy one currency against selling another currency. 

      The FX spot transaction is an agreement to exchange currencies for settlement on the spot date.

      The FX forward transaction is a contractual agreement to exchange a pair of currencies at a set rate on a future date. 

      The non-deliverable forward (NDF) functionality offers the possibility to cash-settle forward contracts of nonconvertible 
        foreign currencies. An NDF differs from a normal FX forward contract in that there is no physical settlement of the two 
        currencies at maturity. Instead, the contract is settled by calculating the difference between the contracted exchange 
        rate and the prevailing spot rate for an agreed upon notional amount of funds.

    # Use Cases

      This API covers the following use cases for **private clients** and **external asset managers**:

      1. Retrieve all available information regarding current and completed orders, including their status

      2. Request foreign exchange trade for a single client account 

      3. Request the cancellation of a not executed foreign exchange order.

    # General Remarks

    * This API definition is inspired by the ISO 20022 standard messages
      [ForeignExchangeTradeCaptureReportV01 (fxtr.031)](https://www.iso20022.org/standardsrepository/type/fxtr.031.001.01),  
      [ForeignExchangeTradeInstructionV04 (fxtr.014)](https://www.iso20022.org/standardsrepository/type/fxtr.014.001.04) and 
      in coordination with the Bankable Assets API for Securities Orders. 

    * Schemas are generally based on datatype definitions with the same name in the
      [ISO 20022 Repository](https://www.iso20022.org/standardsrepository).
      In some cases, schemas may correspond to a restrictive version of the standard datatype definition without some
      or all optional fields.
      Any other deviations to the standard datatype definition are explicitly described below.

    * Pagination is not described in any defined
      [Operation Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.3.md#operation-object).
      A productive implementation of this API may support additional query parameters for implementing pagination
      according to the possibilities of the underlying systems.
      These additional query parameters must be optional and they must not clash with any parameter here defined.

      To allow implementing pagination and avoid clashes, this API will not use the following parameters names
      in this or future versions of the API: `limit`, `offset` and `cursor`.

    * According to the definition of
      [Parameter Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.3.md#parameter-object)
      in the OpenAPI Specification:
      *If `in` is `"header"` and the `name` field is `"Accept"`, `"Content-Type"` or `"Authorization"`, the parameter
      definition SHALL be ignored.* Therefore:
      * The parameter `"Accept"` will not be defined in this file at any place.
      * The parameters `"Content-Type"` and `"Authorization"` are implicitly defined by the fields `content` in
        [Response Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.3.md#response-object)
        and `security` in
        [Operation Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.3.md#operation-object).
